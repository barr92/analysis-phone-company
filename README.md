Which one is a better plan?
You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.

You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze the clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

As an analyst at Megaline, I have been tasked with conducting a preliminary analysis of the company's two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate, to determine which plan generates more revenue.

The findings of this analysis will enable the commercial department to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of the advertising budget.

Objective
The primary objective is to evaluate how much revenue is generated by the two prepaid plans by examining key datpoints about the customers such as their preferences and communication patterns. This analysis will serve as a foundation for making data-driven decisions on advertising budget adjustments to maximize profitability.
